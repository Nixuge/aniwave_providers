# Aniwave providers
The jankiest extractors, mainly for Aniwave and its providers (Vidplay/Mycloud/MegaF/Vidstream, they're all the same thing), provided to u by El Nixu

Latest extractor can be found at https://github.com/Nixuge/anithunder. While this repo previously had a working extractor, that's been moved over to anithunder for easier development. This repo only served as a funny historical archive and a "cache" for the actual main extractor.

# Out of service
Aniwave, and as far as i know all of its sister website have officially been shutdown as of the 27/08/2024.

The updated extractor kept working until the very end, and as of right now still is. Unfortunately, links expire, making the keys now useless.

Was pretty funny to fight against Aniwave, first website I actively scraped. Learned how to make a ton of jank things in Javascript to get those keys out. If you need help with web scraping of some sort, you can dm me on telegram or discord, I should be active on there.

#### This repo is now archived, and will remain archived except if Aniwave comes back (w a different identity?) once ACE has calmed down

### Netu
This repo still has a Netu "imagefinder". No idea if it still works, as I did not support it and did not advertise it anywhere. Its only purpose is to find the coordinates of a play button on an image, required for netu if you don't have a way to get the user to interact with an image, which was my case. If you want to use this, feel free to either fork or contact me, see if I can provide some support.
